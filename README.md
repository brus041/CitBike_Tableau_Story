# Tableau_Project
Used Tableau to analyze trends in Citibike use in New Jersey. 

Project began with collecting data in the form of CSV's and then concatinating all the files to be used easier with Tableau's interface. 

Workflow included creating individual graphs, 2 dashboards, an interactive map, and a story to encompass the entirety of the project. 

Trends were observed by breaking down use of bikes on a daily, weekly, and monthly use, along with which types of bikes were used and by which type of members. 
The most popular locations were then found and placed on a map that included a break down by zip code as well. Graphs also included a break down by station and showcased trends in this regard as well. 

In the tableau folder within the repo, there is a .txt file that goes into depth regarding the outcomes of the analysis above.
