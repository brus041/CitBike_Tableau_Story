Setup:
---------------
The data used in this analysis consists of Citibike Data from August, September, October, and November. Python in utilization with Pandas was used to concatenate all of the separate CSV files into one primary file. This sped up the joining process rather than doing it in Tableau itself. 

Dashboard 1, Page 1 : How does CitiBike Use and Their Members Fare Towards the End of the Year?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This dashboard aims to locate trends in memberships and membership type in the later months of the year, August, September, October, and November. What can be seen in the first visualization is that membership declined by about 33 percent as the year progressed. Next, the types of members are analyzed in a paired bar chart, making it evident that there were 4 types of Citibike riders. These are: casual classic bike riders, casual docked bike riders, member classic bike riders, and member docked bike riders. Immediately we can see that members did not use docked bikes at all, while casual bike riders were predominately classic bike riders. Another trend that can be noticed is that member counts stayed fairly constant, while casual riders showed a consistent decline throughout the four months. Finally, we can see that docked bikes are not popular and should be a focus moving forward. Moving on to the bottom visualization, we have a monthly breakdown of bike use at ten of the most popular stations in New Jersey. Each station experienced a decline in CitiBike use, with September being the highest fairing month in each case as well. 

Dashboard 2, Page 2 : How does CitiBike Use Fare Around the Chaos of a City Work Week?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This dashboard aims to analyze city bike use throughout the work week, with both daily and hourly breakdowns. The top two visualizations represent bike use throughout the day in New Jersey's top 10 most popular locations. Both plots show signs of morning use, and evening use, signified by higher peaks in each graph. This is the result of commuters starting and finishing their days at similar times during the week. Upon closer examination, we can see that Citibike use is much more apparent in the evening, as the later hours in both plots contain the higher peaks. This is likely due to nightlife, alternatives to driving on a night out, not owning a car in the city, or saving money rather than calling an Uber. Note that the highest times are around 6pm or the end of the workday for many individuals. Finally we can see that use is constant during mid day, and non existent during the times most people in the city are asleep. The bottom two plots cover a weekly breakdown of Citibike use. By looking at the lower, leftmost plot, it is evident that bike use gradually increases as the week progresses, with Saturday and Sunday being the two highest days. This is likely due to more leisure time, potential tourist visits, going out, and no daunting work hours. To the right, we have a breakdown by station of how usage fairs during the week. Two of the most notable trend lines are Grove St. Path and South Waterfront Walkway, both with very evident peaks and declines. Grove Street Peaks on Wednesday and has the least number of users on the weekends, whereas South Waterfront Walkway peaks on the weekends and heavily declines during the weekday. This is likely due to location, the lifestyles of those living nearby, and surrounding entertainment or work environments. Considering that South Waterway has higher use in the later hours and peaks on the weekends, it is likely a very popular entertainment location. Grove street is similar but fairs more on the weekdays, meaning it might be in a more industrial, commercial sector rather than a leisure one.  

Map, Page 3 : 
--------------
The map signifies the 10 most popular Citibike Locations. The color overlay highlights the distribution in the median household income amongst the city's population. Clearly we can see that the city itself is for higher earning individuals who can afford the location. It is also likely that Citibikes are a way to save money for those in the city purely for working reasons, saving money for rent, or for commuting purposes. Notice how there are only two stations of interest outside the city zip codes. The location of Grove Street being more isolated, and closer to the edge of the city likely make it a popular departure location in order to get into the center of New Jersey as well.
